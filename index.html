Waffles come in a variety of shapes and sizes and they are eaten all over the world.waffles are lightly sweet and a little bready, although waffles are more so on both counts; they generally have more butter and sugar in the batter and become more caramelized during cooking, so they taste a little richer and more pastry-like.</p>

                             Fresh herbs, saffron, and basmati rice give it 
                            a sweet-floral aroma that hits the nose before you taste it.</p>
